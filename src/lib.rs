//! Big Bag Of Words
//!
//! The "Big Bag Of Words" is used in text analysis and
//! machine learning.  It reduces a text to a collection of
//! words, each with a count of the number of occurrences.
//!
//! This implementation uses zero-copy strings when
//! reasonably possible to improve performance and reduce
//! memory usage.
//! 
//! Words are separated by whitespace, and consist of a
//! span of one or more consecutive letters (any Unicode
//! code point in the "letter" class) with no internal
//! punctuation: leading and trailing punctuation are
//! removed.
//!
//! For example, the text
//!
//! ```text
//! "It ain't over untïl it ain't, over."
//! ```
//!
//! contains the sequence of words `"It"`, `"over"`,
//! `"untïl"`, `"it"`, `"over"`.
//!
//! Words in the bag containing uppercase letters will be
//! represented by their lowercase equivalent.
